#Big Mart Sales Prediction
This project aims to predict the sales of products at different Big Mart stores based on various features. By analyzing historical data, we can identify the factors that impact sales performance and use machine learning models to make accurate sales predictions.

#Project Overview
Big Mart operates a large network of stores across different regions, offering a wide variety of products. Accurately predicting sales can help Big Mart optimize inventory, improve supply chain management, and drive profitability. The dataset used in this project includes information about product characteristics, store types, and other relevant factors.

#Features and Highlights
Data Processing: We preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis to understand key sales trends, identify outliers, and discover relationships among variables.
Machine Learning Models: The project explores multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best performing model. Algorithms include:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
#Model Evaluation: We evaluate models based on metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² Score, and select the model with the best performance.
Deployment: The project is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface where users can input product and store details to predict sales.
